You are building a technical B2B website for ING Global,
the official Korean distributor of Himed, LLC biomaterials.

Important:
- This site must preserve the full technical depth of Himed’s product catalog
- The target users are PhDs, researchers, implant engineers, and R&D professionals
- Accuracy and completeness of specifications are critical
- Do NOT simplify or remove technical data

However:
- The content must be restructured from PDF format into a web-optimized information architecture
- Focus on fast scanning, filtering, and navigation
- Use tables, tabs, accordions, anchors, and side navigation
- Assume users want to jump directly to specifications, not read sequentially

UI/UX goals:
- Allow users to reach any specific product spec within 2–3 clicks
- Provide clear product family grouping
- Separate overview vs deep technical data
- Make PDF downloads and quotation requests easily accessible

Platform:
- Cloudflare Pages (static, high-performance, technical documentation style)

Design & UI Guidelines:

- Visual tone: clinical, scientific, professional (medical / materials science)
- Avoid marketing-heavy visuals or consumer-style UI
- Prefer clean white or light-gray background with subtle grid lines
- Use dense, readable tables similar to technical datasheets
- Left-side navigation for product families and applications
- Use tabs for separating overview vs specifications
- Use accordion sections for deep technical data
- Typography should prioritize readability (no decorative fonts)
- Emphasize clarity, alignment, and hierarchy over visual flair
- This site should feel closer to a scientific catalog than a brand landing page
